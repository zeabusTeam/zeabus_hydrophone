2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell slave_fifo/fifo_departure/genblk1[0].fifo_departure_inst_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) slave_fifo/fifo_arrival/RST,
slave_fifo/fifo_departure/genblk1[0].fifo_departure_inst/RST,
slave_fifo/fifo_departure/genblk1[1].fifo_departure_inst/RST,
slave_fifo/fifo_departure/genblk1[2].fifo_departure_inst/RST
slave_fifo/fifo_departure/genblk1[3].fifo_departure_inst/RST. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell trigger/FIFO36E1_inst_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) trigger/FIFO36E1_inst/RST. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -3.136 ns between slave_fifo/SLWR_reg/C (clocked by sys_clk) and SLWR (clocked by sys_clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -3.140 ns between slave_fifo/SLOE_reg/C (clocked by sys_clk) and SLOE (clocked by sys_clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -3.168 ns between slave_fifo/SLRD_reg/C (clocked by sys_clk) and SLRD (clocked by sys_clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#4 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -3.171 ns between slave_fifo/SLCS_reg/C (clocked by sys_clk) and SLCS (clocked by sys_clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#5 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -3.271 ns between slave_fifo/A0_reg/C (clocked by sys_clk) and A[0] (clocked by sys_clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#6 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -3.297 ns between slave_fifo/PKTEND_reg/C (clocked by sys_clk) and PKTEND (clocked by sys_clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
